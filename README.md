Code Explanation ::

**  The filter() method is used to remove any employees who have the "developer" job title in the printDeveloperByMap() function, and the map() method is used to log each developer.

** In the printDeveloperByForEach() function, we iterate over the employees array using forEach() and log each employee with the profession of "developer".

** We create a new employee object, add it to the array of employees, and then log the newly added employee in the addData() function.

** We build a new array (updatedEmployees) in the removeAdmin() function that excludes the workers with the title "admin" using the filter() method. The updatedEmployees array is then logged.

** In the concatenateArray() function, we create a new array (newArray) with three objects that have different properties. We then use the concat() method to concatenate the employee array with the newArray, creating a new array (combinedArray). Finally, we log the combinedArray.
